                <br><br>There are a few purposes of this website. It serves as an opportunity to display my work experience, education, projects, and technical skills. This material has the potential to be viewed by potential employers, so it’s important to make it high quality and accurate. It also serves the purpose of allowing me to work on my web development skills. The main goal of this website is to collect and display information pertinent to my work/technical experience. Further objectives of the site include working on previously acquired HTML/CSS skills. Since I’m writing this site for a university course, I will also be learning new and updated web features that will be taught and implemented through the creation of this site. The site also has some unique requirements, so I’ll be able to explore some other portfolio related information about myself and display that on the website. The website contains pages displaying an about page, projects/experience, personal reflection, and my official resume.</p>
