                <p>My name is Jacob McIntosh. I'm an Information Technology student at the <em>University of Missouri</em>. Some of my hobbies include coding, cooking, watching movies, and spending time with family. Some of my other interests include minimalism, mindfulness, custom mechanical keyboards, and technology. <br>At the university, I have taken <em>many</em> courses on technology concepts. These courses include Object-Oriented programming, web development, database management, software engineering, and digital media design. Currently, I’m taking a course in computer system administration, beginner graphic design, and more web development. I will also be working on my capstone this semester. I’ve worked on many projects while in school. I made a NASA Photo of the Day API website, replicas of cognitive training games in Unity, and data processing programs. After graduation, I plan to get a job in software or computer administration. I am looking forward to this semester! <strong>M-I-Z Z-O-U!</strong></p>
