        My name is Jacob McIntosh. I’m a senior Information Technology student here at Mizzou. After graduation, I’m looking to get a job in software engineering or computer systems administration. I do have some previous web application development experience! Since I’m an IT major, I’ve done all sorts of development. I’ve taken a basic web development course covering topics from HTML/CSS to JavaScript and PHP. I also wrote a web application for a software engineering class that generated graphs for stock data. I haven’t learned any of the modern web development techniques, but I do enjoy web development and designing websites. I expect this course to cover some basic HTML and CSS. I think it will have a bit more of a unique take on development than what I’m used to since it’s not a class in the IT program, but IS_LT. With the skills learned from this course, I hope to take my understanding of the fundamentals of web development to the next level. One of my favorite hobbies is cooking. It’s so much fun to find new recipes and try new things with all sorts of different ingredients. I’m still a beginner, so not every recipe works out. I still really enjoy it. In my free time, I like to watch movies and YouTube videos, spend time with friends and family, and listen to music.
